# React Practice Project

This project is a hands-on practice React application built using **Vite**. It demonstrates core concepts of React including reusable components, props, conditional rendering, and dynamic list rendering.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The following React concepts and JavaScript fundamentals are applied in this project:

### ✅ React Core Concepts
- **JSX** – Writing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript
- **Functional Components** – All components are built using ES6 functional style
- **Props** – Passing data between components using props
- **Conditional Rendering** – Rendering UI based on specific conditions
- **Component Reusability** – Shared component logic (e.g., `TabButton`, `Header`)
- **Dynamic List Rendering** – Rendering lists using `.map()` (e.g., in `CoreConcepts`)
- **Data-Driven UI** – Using external JS data structures (`data.js`) to render content

### ✅ JavaScript Concepts
- **Array & Object Manipulation** – Handling content using JS objects and arrays
- **Event Handling** – Functions triggered on user interaction (`onClick`)
- **ES6 Module System** – `import` / `export` for modular code

### ✅ Tooling & Setup
- **Vite** – Used as the build tool for fast development and optimized builds
- **File Structure** – Well-organized component-based folder structure

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server

## 📌 Notes
